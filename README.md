# LokalEye: A Mobile-Based Neighborhood Watch System for Barangay

LokalEye is a community-focused mobile application designed to enhance neighborhood safety and reporting. It allows residents to report barangay-level incidents, attach multimedia evidence, and receive timely updates through mobile notifications.

## 📁 Branching Strategy
We use a **feature branching** workflow. Each feature is developed in its own branch and merged to `main` upon completion and approval.
